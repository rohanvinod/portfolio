                                      <p>  In Computer Science Pricipals(CSP), I modified an app in App Inventor 
                                        called PaintPot. PaintPot is a drawing app
                                        that allows the user to draw something on 
                                        a screen with the touch of a finger. Before, 
                                        the app only included 3 colors, Red, Blue, and Green.
                                        We wanted to expand the range of colors used
                                        so we made 4 more colors, Pink, Orange, Black,
                                        and Yellow. Next, we wanted to add more strokes
                                        for the lines to provide more variety in the
                                        art created by the user. This proved to be a difficult
                                        task because it was hard to change the actual 
                                        look of the line, so we just made a slider to
                                        allow the user to choose the thickness of the line 
                                        that they want to draw with.

                                        This was a research project dedicated to learning all about web cookies. I talked about what cookies were and what their function was. Cookies are tiny packets of data stored on browsers that contain simple infpormation such as logins and passowrds. Why do you need cookies? Well, cookies can make it much easier to browse the web. For instance, say you want to login to a website but forgot your passcode. With cookies, the passsword will automatically fill and you won't need to remember your passsword the next time you login to the same website. Cookeis just make browsing very convineient. However one downide to cookies are that they can be easily intercepted by hackers and the data can become compromised. Cookies are not very secure.

                                        In my Computer Science Principles class(CSP), we created a python text adventure. A text adventure is like a 
                                        normal story, but the difference is that the user gets to choose the plot rather than it being made by the author.
                                        Me and my partner, Abhishek Sarepaka, brainstormed ideas on how we wanted the story to flow. W cfeated a diagram
                                         which shows all of the posible options the user can make. Each option leads to a different scene. Once we finished
                                         brainstorming, we started to code. We created different functions for each scene and created text for all possible
                                         options the user can make. We worked on this project in a methodical manner and finished before the gallery walk
                                         of all of our projects. We communicated well together and got a decent grade for it.

                                        This project was mainly focused on web security, and included some tips on how to detect, and delete malicious programs. I went over some ways to detect malicious processes running in a system. Some ways to detect these malicious processes would be to observe if your system has a lack of storage space. This would mean that some maliciopus files could be downlaoded. A simple fix for this would be to search through your files and find any suspicious file names or names you do not recognize. you can also use some antivirus softwares to help you detect the files with more ease. Once you detect the suspicious file, it will need to be deleted completely off the system.
