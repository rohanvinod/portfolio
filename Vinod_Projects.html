                                        <h3>AppInventor Project</h3>
                                    </strong>
                                    <h5>
                                        In Computer Science Pricipals(CSP), I modified an app in App Inventor 
                                        called PaintPot. PaintPot is a drawing app
                                        that allows the user to draw something on 
                                        a screen with the touch of a finger. Before, 
                                        the app only included 3 colors, Red, Blue, and Green.
                                        We wanted to expand the range of colors used
                                        so we made 4 more colors, Pink, Orange, Black,
                                        and Yellow. Next, we wanted to add more strokes
                                        for the lines to provide more variety in the
                                        art created by the user. This proved to be a difficult
                                        task because it was hard to change the actual 
                                        look of the line, so we just made a slider to
                                        allow the user to choose the thickness of the line 
                                        that they want to draw with.

                                    </strong>
                                    <h5>
                                        In Computer Science Pricipals(CSP), I created a game using scratch,and
                                        it's objective was to get a ball, to the other 
                                        side of the map without touching the ground.
                                        The ball would gain more altitude by touching
                                        the platforms, and if the ball misses the plaform
                                        it would plummet straight to the ground and the user
                                        will start from the first level again until 
                                        they reach the end of the level. The coding 
                                        for the game was fairly easy, but there were a few 
                                        issues. It was difficult to program the ball to gain 
                                        altitude after touching the platforms, but I managed
                                        to make it work by making new variables in the code.

                                        In my Computer Science Principles class(CSP), we created a python text adventure. A text adventure is like a 
                                        normal story, but the difference is that the user gets to choose the plot rather than it being made by the author.
                                        Me and my partner, Abhishek Sarepaka, brainstormed ideas on how we wanted the story to flow. W cfeated a diagram
                                         which shows all of the posible options the user can make. Each option leads to a different scene. Once we finished
                                         brainstorming, we started to code. We created different functions for each scene and created text for all possible
                                         options the user can make. We worked on this project in a methodical manner and finished before the gallery walk
                                         of all of our projects. We communicated well together and got a decent grade for it.

                                        In Computer Science Principals(CSP), I was to satisfy a certain client with specific guidelineswith a 
                                        design, or frame coded using Image Manipulation. I chose Client #2, which was Family. I was to create a 
                                        picture frame which satisfied the need and wants of the client. Me and my partner Riya Kulkarni brainstormed
                                        the basic picture frame design. We created a document on which we could put all of our brainstormed designs 
                                        in, and we started to work. I first created a basic single-layered frame around the image, then made it more 
                                        complex over time. I did run into problems though. I pasted square shaped images in the frame, and when it was 
                                        around a smaller image, the images would say the same size and overlap. I fixed this by making a program that checks 
                                        the length and width of the image and sizes the frame accordingly. My partner and I worked well and we communicated often.
