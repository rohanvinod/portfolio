                                            <h5>My name is Rohan and I am 15 years old. I am currently attending Dublin high school as a freshman. My career goal is to become a software
                                 engineer at a successful company. I was born on November 15, 2003 in Miami, Florida. After I turned 2, I moved to chicago, where most of my
                                 elementary education occured. I used to learn simple programming languages such as scratch, and interactive games that helped me build my analytical thinking skills. 
                                 Chicago was very cold duringthe winter,
                                and I often found myself by the fireplace all the time, warming myself up. After two years, our family decided that Chicago was too cold for us to endure
                                so we packed our bags and moved the California. My fist day of school was hard and it took me awaile to get aquainted with the new workload of 
                                middle school. Middle school, and High school opened me to a whole new level of programming and I began to learn more complex languages such as 
                                Python, Javascript, CSS, Command Line, and C++. My father, a software engineer at Smule, helped me study new programming languages everyday, 
                                helping me get to where I am today. My mother, a product manager who works at visa, encouraged me to learn math 2-3 levels higher than what I was 
                                currently learning. I love science and I especially love to preform experimnts in class as it's one of the most 
                                interesting activities we do in that class. Spanish is my least favorite subject in high school, even though I am fluent
                                 in the language. The creation of this website has taught me many things about myself, as well as learning different
                                  programming languages, and it brings me one step closer to my career goal.</h5>
