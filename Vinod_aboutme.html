I am 17 years old and I am currenty studying in Dublin High and planning to major in computer engineering. I started programming at a very young age. In elementary school, I did some basic robotics at a robotics club in my after school. We programmed the robots to perform different functions and detect obstacles, then move past them. As the years went by, I began to turn my attention from robotics to app development. I bought a mac and downloaded Xcode, which was an application that allowed me to build ios apps and run them on my device. I started with a very simple application, a multplication tester. The goal for this app was to test the simple multiplication tables from 1 to 10, and help elementary school kids learn them as quickly as possible. I had a few beta testers test the app and recieved a ton of feedback. I then published my app on the App Store and decided to create some other apps as well. <br>Not only did I develop Apps but I also started to learn HTML and CSS. I started off with some courses on Codecademy, which taught me most of what I know about HTML and CSS, including syntax, error fixes and webpage structure. I did some basic Python programming as well, however I did not become fluent in it. Currenty, I am learning about web security. I am focusing on how to stay secure on the web, and keep my personal data private. I did a few research projects goiving a few tips on how to keep data private, and the security risks of using cookies on the web for storing personal data.<br> I have gained quite a few skills working with others as I have been collaborating more with my teams. I am a very social person, and my problem solving skills have developed more. I now have the ability to help others and teach them what is right and wrong. My education in High School has taught me a lot regarding the diiferent careers in the engineerng field. <br>After learning about the diverse careers, I have set my sights towards a data engineer. There are 2 reasons for this. One, my dad works as a data engineer and it would be nice to work in a job that he has a lot of experience in that way I will know how the job works and what is expected of me. The second reason is that I really like to work with data and analyze it. A Data Engineer works with computer systems and designs and develops them, which I find to be very fun.In my Cybersecurity class, I have learned a lot about databases, and the flow of data through the internet.  However in order to obtain this career, I will need to gain some work experience.</h5>
