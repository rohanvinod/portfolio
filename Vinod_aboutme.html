                                            <h5>My name is Rohan Vinod. I am 17 years old and I am currenty studying in Dublin High and planning to major in computer engineering. I started programming at a very young age. In elementary school, I did some basic robotics at a robitcs club in my after school. We used to program the robots to perform different functions and detect obstacles and move past them. As the years went by, I began to turn my attention from robotics to app development. I bough a mac and downloaded Xcode, which was an application that allowed me to build ios apps and run them on my device. I started with a very simple application, a multplication tester. The goal for this app was to test the simple multiplication tables from 1 to 10, and help elementary school kids learn them as quickly as possible. I hasd a few beta testers test the app and recieved a ton of feedback. I then published my app on the App Store and decided to create some other apps as well. Not only did I develop Apps but I also started to learn HTML and CSS. I started off with some courses on Codecademy, which taught me most of what I know about HTML and CSS, including syntax, error fixes and webpage structure. I did some basic Python programming as well, however I did not become fluent in it. Currenty, I am learning about web security. I am focusing on how to stay secure on the web, and keep my personal data private. I did a few research projects goiving a few tips on how to keep data private, and the security risks of using cookies on the web for storing personal data.  </h5>
