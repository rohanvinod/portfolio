                                            <h5>My name is Rohan and I am 15 years old. I am currently attending Dublin high school as a freshman. I was born on November 15, 2003 in 
                                Miami, Florida. After I turned 2, I moved to chicago, where most of my elementary education occured. I used to learn simple programming 
                                languages such as scratch, and interactive games that help us build our analytical thinking skills. Chicago was very cold duringthe winter,
                                and I often found myself by the fireplace all the time, warming myself up. After two years, our family decided that Chicago was too cold for us to endure
                                and we packed our bags and moved the California. My fist day of school was hard and it took me awaile to get aquainted with the new workload of 
                                middle school. Middle school, and High school opened me to a whole new level of programming and I began to learn more complex languages such as 
                                Python, Javascript, CSS, Command Line, and C++. My father, a software engineer at Smule, helped me study new programming languages everyday, 
                                helping me get to where I am today. My mother, a buisnesswoman who works at visa, encouraged me to learn math 2-3 levels higher than what I was 
                                currently learning.</h5>
