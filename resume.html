                                            <h5>I have learned a lot about the general field of engineerng. When I was a little kid, I always though engineering was just coding but I later learned that there are many different careers in this industry. I have been on a few of field trips that revealed what it is to be an engineer, and the diverse careers in the industry. In my Computer Science Principals class, I went on a field trip to the BART station. We met a technician who worked on some computer systems that run the station.  I learned a lot about how hard these jobs are, and how complex the programs managing the trains are. It takes a very skilled technician to fix some of the harware and program software that organizes the trains and people efficienty. We toured the different facilities within the station, went over a few key roles that help the station fuction, and then startd to head back. Though the field trip was brief, I have gained a more comprehensive knowlegde of how important these jobs are to society. I have also had a few guest speakers from a few companies visit my class and speak about their roles in their company, and some general descriptions of their job. One such person came from a contruction company. This visit came during my Honors Principles of Engineering Class. He was an architect, who designed roadways and cityscapes. He went over some requirements for such a job and described the work load. I have considered a job like this, as it requires little to no programming knowledge and creativity is encouraged. I have realized that the majority of engineering jobs require problem solving skills.    </h5>
